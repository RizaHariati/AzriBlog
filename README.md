## Description

I always thought Laravel is only used for back-end side of development. But after learning from a very professional, very thorough Web Programming UNPAS tutorial on Laravel, I realized that it's actually very good for a simple front-end side of web development.\
Based on that tutorial, I created this blog website, with the help of the good old Bootstrap and MySQL, show casing my laravel implementation on routing, templating HTML, and authentication.
